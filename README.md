## Features

- **Modding Tools**: Edit and compile assets for Spider-Man 2, including actors, configs, nodegraphs, materialgraphs and materials.

- **In-Launcher Game Running**: Quickly launch any program, including the game, to preview your mods without leaving the app.
- **Quick Launch Menu**: Customize your own quick launch programs with custom paths and icons.

## Getting Started
While Insomniac Engine isn't required for most of the program's functionality, you'll still need to do the following:
- Set "IG_ROOT" environment variable to "C:\", or any other disk you prefer ("D:\", "E:\").
- Place your LunaToolbox.exe in %IG_ROOT%i30\LunaToolbox.exe
- Move the Utilities folder into %IG_ROOT%i30 - keep it intact unless you know what you're doing.
